# Linked List 

## Data structure
Linear data structure
stored at non-contiguous memory locations
each item in the list has a pointer to the next item

```
  [ {data: 1, next: 2 }, {data: 2, next: nil }]
```

## Common methods
insert (at beginning, end, and middle)
remove (at beginning, end, and middle)
head: returns the head

## Different types
singly linked list: only keeps up with next item for each node
doubly linked list: keeps up with next and previous items for each node
circular linked list: end links to head

## Common use cases
