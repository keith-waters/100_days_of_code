# Array

## Data structure
collection of items stored in contiguous memory locations
0 indexed linear list of data
can hold any other data structure
depending on language, data types can be mixed

Most languages, (that I know) use square brackets to denote an array
```
  [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

## Common methods
push
pop
shift
unshift
length
insert
...and lots more depending on the language


## Common use cases
any time you need to store a list of similar data
- list of addresses
- list of users
- ...
