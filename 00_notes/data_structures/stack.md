# Stack

## Data structure
linear data structure that follow
Last in, first out

I usually think of a stack of plates. When you add a new one, you add it to the top of the stack. When you need a plate, you take it from the top of the stack.


## Common methods
push: adds an item to the top
pop: removes and returns the top item
peek: shows the top items

## Common use cases
- undo, redo feature of an operating system
- reverse the order of another data structure (linked list)
