# Queue 

## Data structure
linear data structure
First in, first out

I think about it as standing in line(or a queue) at the grocery store. To get in line, you have to stand at the back. To pay for your groceries, you have to get to the front of the line. Then leave from there.

## Common methods
enqueue: adds an item to the end of the queue
dequeue: removes and returns an item from the beginning of the queue

## Common use cases
- iterative breadth first search of a tree/graph
