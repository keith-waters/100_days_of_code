# 100 Days of Code 
100 days of code challenge with Ruby

## Day 7
Review k'th smallest
- k'th smallest element with quick sort [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/)
  - better understanding of the partition method

Easy problems on binarysearch.com

## Day 6
Review k'th smallest
- k'th smallest element with min and max heap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/)
  - much better understanding of the heap implementation

K'th smallest
- quick sort
  - got it working but don't understand it...

## Day 5
Review array rearrangements
- Odds and evens [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri-arrj-even-arri/)
  - This made way more sense today!

Sorting
- k'th smallest element with min and max heap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/)
  - min heap stuuumpted me. copy coded it from the c++ example and it started to sink in
  - max heap was easier after working with min heap, but still a bit confusing

## Day 4
Review of array rearrangements
- hash_set, swap_elements [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - swap_elements made more sense this time
- reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)

Array rearrangements
- Odds and evens [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri-arrj-even-arri/)

Sorting
- Simple, min heap
  - simple solution, super easy
  - got stuck on implementing the min heap...

## Day 3
Review of array rearrangements
- Naive and check and replace [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)

Array rearrangments
- hash_set, swap_elements [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - hash_set made sense from the get go
  - swap_elements confused me at first
- reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)
  - reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive made sense. Had done the iterave version in array rotations on Day 1

## Day 2
Review of array rotations
- juggling still strange to me
- didn't bother with block swap

Array rearrangement
- Naive approach, Check and replace [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - naive made sense
  - check and replace still a bit confusing

## Day 1
Array rotations
- Temp array, One by one, Juggling [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-rotation/)
  - Temp array and one by one made sense
  - struggled with juggling algo

- Reversal [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/)
  - this was easy to understand

- Block Swap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/block-swap-algorithm-for-array-rotation/)
  - super confusing... got the recursive one to work, don't understand it though
