## Day 1
Array rotations
- Temp array, One by one, Juggling [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-rotation/)
  - Temp array and one by one made sense
  - struggled with juggling algo
- Reversal [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/)
  - this was easy to understand
- Block Swap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/block-swap-algorithm-for-array-rotation/)
  - super confusing... got the recursive one to work, don't understand it though
