# 100 Days of Code 
100 days of code challenge with Ruby

## Day 3
Review of array rearrangements
- Naive and check and replace [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
Array rearrangments
- hash_set, swap_elements [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - hash_set made sense from the get go
  - swap_elements confused me at first
- reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)
 - reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive made sense. Had done the iterave version in array rotations on Day 1

## Day 2
Review of array rotations
- juggling still strange to me
- didn't bother with block swap
Array rearrangement
- Naive approach, Check and replace [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - naive made sense
  - check and replace still a bit confusing

## Day 1
Array rotations
- Temp array, One by one, Juggling [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-rotation/)
  - Temp array and one by one made sense
  - struggled with juggling algo
- Reversal [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/)
  - this was easy to understand
- Block Swap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/block-swap-algorithm-for-array-rotation/)
  - super confusing... got the recursive one to work, don't understand it though
