# 100 Days of Code 
100 days of code challenge with Ruby

## Day 19
- Graphs!
  - adjacency list [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)
    - made way more sense once I could visualize the list
  - breadth first search [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/)
  - depth first recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/)
  - depth first iterative 
    - Twitch chat helped me figure this out!! use a stack instead of queue for breadth first
    - thanks maldocrosse and vizghar


## Day 18
- CodinGame!!!
  - Played Ghost in the Cell and Power of Thor

## Day 17
- Review Trie
  - remove [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-delete/)
  - display [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-display-content/)
  - moved through these quickly!
- CodinGame!!!
  - this was so cool. definitely need to do this more!

## Day 16
- Review Trie insert and search [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/)
  - made more sense today :)
- Implemented Trie operations
  - remove [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-delete/)
  - display [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-display-content/)
    - this was odd translating from the c++ code. had to figure out how the characters needed to be displayed

## Day 15
- Review Linked list reversal [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/)
  - got the iterative version working
- Moved into Tries [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/)
  - super confused at first. thought each node would keep up with the letter value ("a") but it keeps up with it by using an index in an array with 26 values
  - excited to review this tomorrow!

## Day 14
- Review linked list opertions (see Day 13 below)
- Linked list reverse - [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/)
  - looked at Geeks for Geeks after the fact
  - figured it out on my own using a stack!

## Day 13
- Linked lists with lots of operations
  - unshift, insert, and push [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-2-inserting-a-node/)
  - remove [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-3-deleting-node/)
  - remove at position [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-a-linked-list-node-at-a-given-position/)
  - length - iterative and recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-length-of-a-linked-list-iterative-and-recursive/)

## Day 12
- Review depth first iterative preorder, inorder and post order
  - made more sense today. don't think I could implement from memory
- Easy coding problems on binarysearch.com

## Day 11
Binary trees
- Review breadth first iterative and depth first recursive
- Depth first iterative inorder and post order
  - figured out inorder and preorder pretty easily [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion/)
  - had to look up another article for postorder [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-postorder-traversal-using-stack/)
  - pretty easy to implement, though not sure i understand the postorder well

## Day 10
Binary trees!
- Breadth first traversal - iterative [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-tree-traversal/)
  - this seemed overwhelming at first. but way better when I figured out the queue method
- Depth first search - recursive
  - inorder, preorder, postorder [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/)
  - did this one from memory!!! learned about the different orders.

## Day 9
Review Stacks
- Tower of hanoi - iterative [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-tower-of-hanoi/)

Stacks
- Tower of hanoi - recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/)
  - so much confusion around this, but got it to work

Queue
- implement a queue with 2 stacks [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-using-stacks/)
  - this was pretty straitforward

Tree
- Started looking at breadth first search on binary tree....

## Day 8
Stacks
- Tower of hanoi - iterative [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-tower-of-hanoi/)
  - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) was super helpful 
  - confused for the first hour, copy coded, then cleaned up the code and it made a bit more sense

Easy problems on binarysearch.com

## Day 7
Review k'th smallest
- k'th smallest element with quick sort [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/)
  - better understanding of the partition method

Easy problems on binarysearch.com

## Day 6
Review k'th smallest
- k'th smallest element with min and max heap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/)
  - much better understanding of the heap implementation

K'th smallest
- quick sort
  - got it working but don't understand it...

## Day 5
Review array rearrangements
- Odds and evens [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri-arrj-even-arri/)
  - This made way more sense today!

Sorting
- k'th smallest element with min and max heap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/)
  - min heap stuuumpted me. copy coded it from the c++ example and it started to sink in
  - max heap was easier after working with min heap, but still a bit confusing

## Day 4
Review of array rearrangements
- hash_set, swap_elements [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - swap_elements made more sense this time
- reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)

Array rearrangements
- Odds and evens [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri-arrj-even-arri/)

Sorting
- Simple, min heap
  - simple solution, super easy
  - got stuck on implementing the min heap...

## Day 3
Review of array rearrangements
- Naive and check and replace [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)

Array rearrangments
- hash_set, swap_elements [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - hash_set made sense from the get go
  - swap_elements confused me at first
- reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)
  - reverse_iterative, reverse_recursive made sense. Had done the iterave version in array rotations on Day 1

## Day 2
Review of array rotations
- juggling still strange to me
- didn't bother with block swap

Array rearrangement
- Naive approach, Check and replace [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-array-arri/)
  - naive made sense
  - check and replace still a bit confusing

## Day 1
Array rotations
- Temp array, One by one, Juggling [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-rotation/)
  - Temp array and one by one made sense
  - struggled with juggling algo

- Reversal [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/)
  - this was easy to understand

- Block Swap [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/block-swap-algorithm-for-array-rotation/)
  - super confusing... got the recursive one to work, don't understand it though
